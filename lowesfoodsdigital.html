		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The Setup</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>We all know technology giants, in this case specifically Amazon, have been incredibly disruptive to a wide range of established industries. Well-known brands and players with long tenures in these spaces must learn to adapt quickly to the rapid pace of innovation or else are often forced to cease operations.</p>
		<p>The same has happened (and is continuing today) in the grocery industry. The Amazon model of online browsing, item discovery, and convenient ordering has swept through many existing retail markets and is now poised to radically change grocery shopping as well. Already squeezed by Wal-Mart, industry players will now feel pressure from across their digital channels from Amazon over the coming years, especially following their acquisition of Whole Foods.</p>
		<p class="last-p">But interestingly, data shows that users still browse their local grocery websites to ingest content as well as shop and discover items. They want to read about where their food comes from, what's happening around them in the community, and find new recipes. This creates an additional challenge for online grocery: let users easily find, discover, and buy the items they want, <i>and</i> present content, without compromising on either experience.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project-image-area project-grid-image-area project-grid-item project-img6col"><img src="images/projects/lowesfoodsdigital/lowesfoodsdigital-hero.jpg"></div>

		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>Lowes Foods leveled that challenge squarely at The Variable: What can the Lowes Foods website become that matches Amazon in item discovery and ease of shopping while maintaining the great mix of content around local communities and farms that consumers have come to expect? While the overall team (including myself) set to work designing and mocking up the Lowes Foods digital experience of five years in the future, I also created the design depicted on this page: the Lowes Foods web presence of <i>ten</i> years into the future*. We showed this concept at the end of our overall presentation in an Apple-style "One More Thing…" addendum, and the client came out of the meeting very impressed and inspired.</p>
		<p class="fineprint-p last-p">* The web moves <i>very</i> fast. This project was presented in 2015 as a web experience ten years into the future and just three years later now feels closer to an idea whose time has come than something you would today expect to see going live in 2025. I expect Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods in 2017 accelerated this perception.</p>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Focus on Search</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>In one major area, I decided it was critical to bow to Amazon in order to compete: keeping search front and center. By giving users a prompt right up top upon the website's initial load, you allow users coming specifically to shop to begin immediately. A series of links below the search bar auto-fills common searches and categories from other users.</p>
		<p>For visitors still looking to browse content, we have a fairly expected layout below: a hero carousel that can advertise specials, and modular content blocks that can be customized by Lowes Foods to feature articles about their signature offerings, show upcoming events at the user's local store, play brand videos, display recipes, and more.</p>
		<p class="last-p">The innovative feature is what happens when the user begins searching. As soon as the begin typing in the large search bar all the modular content blocks slide quickly down the page to make way for search results, which are broken up first into groceries (always front-and-center), then article and recipe content results. It's important to note that everything happens on the same page: the user is never taken away.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Staying Put</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>Keeping users on the same page where they started when searching is important. When you're presenting not only a range of products but curated content selections like articles, community events, and recipes, things can become confusing quickly if an experience is not designed to guide the user in a forgiving way.</p>
		<p>To help avoid users becoming lost, I created interactions to allow for content consumption within the same page: modals, flipcards, and scrollframes.</p>
		<p>Modals are commonplace across the web and serve our needs in this user experience by constraining focus to the content (especially if lightboxed) without ushering users to a different page. This type of presentation is well suited to video and most articles, especially those longer in length.</p>
		<p>Flipcards present information on the "front" and "back" by rotating the content block around the Y axis, giving the illusion of depth. I implemented this interaction because of the inclusion of recipes; we all have a box of hand-me-down recipes written on both sides of index cards and letting users "flip" our digital recipe cards creates a small skeumorphic connection, perhaps even a slightly emotional one, to a familiar experience.</p>
		<p class="last-p">Scrollframes present information which overflows the height of the content block, requiring users to scroll within it. This interaction used to be common on the greater web in the form of iframes and is generally disliked (or at least is by me) but if implemented with intention toward the length of contained content can be effective. In these layouts I used scrollframes for short lists of events and some articles.</p></div>
