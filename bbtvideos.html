		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The Setup</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>Let's face it; many of the products banks and financial institutions offer besides storing your money aren't very sexy. The explanations for many of these offerings are often overly convoluted and dry, services with very abstract features can be hard to translate in a simple and approachable way, and products are usually explained through verbose white papers or information packets instead of delivered in a medium that's well designed and easy to understand.</p>
		<p class="last-p">BB&amp;T was encountering these issues in its traditional methods of finding clients for its Commerce Gateway Payables, Medical Data Lockbox, and Vault360 products. I was tasked, working alongside copywriter <a class="project-a link" href="http://rtferrell.com/" target="_blank">R.T. Ferrell</a>, with concepting and designing a series of explanatory videos to illustrate these products in a more easily understood way.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Creating a Clear Style</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>These videos were scoped and assigned separately, but I knew when creating the first video that a series would eventually follow. With that in mind, I set out to create an approachable, clean visual look that could be easily picked back up when designing the other videos, and even emulated by other designers for additional videos or deliverables down the road if the client so chose.</p>
		<p class="last-p">The final visuals are simple, with a very icon-centric look. Consistent, slightly emboldened stroke weight, with round terminals and corners skew the videos' style in a more child-like direction; this was an intentional choice and helps make the complex banking products feel understandable, but is never pushed so far as to seem juvenile. Simpler illustrations are shown as solid shapes (like turning gears), while lines and outlines are used to add detail for more complex visuals (such as a robot's head). Shadows and glare are usually avoided, except where depth can more quickly sell a shape as an object.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Giving Direction</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>While I can design animatic videos, creating the animations in AfterEffects is not in my (current) wheel house. To carry these videos through to completion, we enlisted the help of animator Nick Gray.</p>
		<p>A great animator partner can be hard to find; you need someone who can easily understand your guidance and who innately knows when and where to make his or her own mark on the video without being too heavy-handed with flourishes and other little additions. Nick has always done an excellent job understanding my vision and makes the project go faster by being easy to instruct.</p>
		<p class="last-p">For direction, I create keyframes of every major view in the video and interstitials between those for any sequences where I expect demonstrative explanation is warranted. Each frame gets a "script sync" title below it on one Illustrator layer showing what needs to be onscreen throughout the voiceover, and a direction note on another layer explaining any movement or transitions. Working this way takes a little more time on my part up front creating a robust and exhaustive array of assets, but it ultimately saves us time through all subsequent rounds as it bolsters client understanding in the initial presentation, feedback is easier to incorporate, and the animator has everything they need to efficiently build the video.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The Result</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p class="last-p">Each video is approachable and understandable, with even heavily abstractive concepts represented visually for potential clients. While it's likely most viewers will only be interested in one of the services which received a video, and therefore may only watch one of our series, I'm pleased with the very cohesive nature of these assets. Brand stewardship is always a priority and must be considered across all touchpoints; by making these videos simple, effective, and consistent, we didn't just give BB&amp;T three video files… we added a small piece to their overall brand.</p>
