		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The Setup</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>When we think of minority groups in our society that face challenges, in this day and age the people around us with intellectual or developmental disabilities ("IDD" for short) probably aren't top of mind. But maybe they should be: people with IDD make up 10% of the world's population, which makes them the largest minority group.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, most individuals within this group feel isolated from others, both with and without IDD. And while most people with disabilities report they wish to work, over 80% of them are unemployed. Many of these people aspire to work and have skills and value they wish to give to their communities, but are not able to find a job.</p>
		<p class="last-p">This is a problem, but it's the sort of problem that has a solution in which we can all play a part. By engaging and interacting more frequently with others who have IDD, those of us without IDD can help remove stigmas and can encounter and defeat our own prejudices and biases. So when a group of people got together with the mission to open a coffee shop where people with IDD could have jobs and interact with the broader community, they and The Variable set to work doing just that.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Naming & Ideation</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>A novel business deserves a novel name. Our associate creative director (and general czar of all things brand-do-goodness) <a class="project-a link" href="http://www.tallskinnyguy.com/" target="_blank">Gary Bostwick</a> came up with the invented word "Moji."</p>
		<p>"Moji" serves us well by sounding approachable and playful. Its similarity to "emoji" connects it to the little cartoony smiles that have suffused our culture. And like any word, it needs meaning. We define "Moji" as: The jolt of joy you get when you make others happy.</p>
		<p class="last-p">With a name in place, our design team set to work generating identity concepts. With such a strong mission, everyone threw in and contributed a wide range of ideas. While one of my concepts was not ultimately chosen to represent <a class="project-a link" href="http://www.mojicoffee.org/" target="_blank">Moji Coffee + More</a>, I am proud of the ideas I developed and am happy to share my two concepts which made it in front of the client below.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The "Heart" Concept</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>My first concept utilizes bespoke casual script lettering to create the "Moji" wordmark. I pursued this direction because it has much more humanity than a typical typed out wordmark and looks inviting. I also began work on this mark knowing I wanted to hide an outline of a heart as the capital M.</p>
		<p class="last-p">I really like where this concept ended up and that the heart-M can be used on its own as a tertiary brand element like a social icon. I created an additional version of this cut-down mark while exploring apparel and color options; it's contained in a round stroke that can either represent a capital C for coffee or an abstracted coffee ring stain.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The "Smile" Concept</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>My other concept is one I'm especially proud of. The challenge of Moji Coffee + More, in its simplest form, is to bridge the gap between people with IDD who want to be involved in everyday society and contribute, and people without IDD who may feel uncomfortable at first if they've never had the chance to get to know someone who has IDD.</p>
		<p>I really wanted to create something that, in some small way at least, could play the part in being that bridge. Can a brand <i>really</i> do that though? Act as a media through which a connection, perhaps even a friendship can begin? I do this job because I firmly believe that the answer is <b>yes.</b></p>
		<p class="last-p">This concept came to be as I was creating letterforms for a bespoke wordmark. I wrapped the descender of the J around the bottom of the O and noticed that the two glyphs looked like an abstract character waving. And then I had an idea… What if our brand could facilitate an enjoyable interaction, without the need for a single spoken word? By utilizing the O as a head, with the counter inside as a canvas for a face, we can let our employees and customers leave their own mark on the brand and extend a small human touch between each other.</p></div>

		<div class="project-image-area project-grid-image-area project-grid-item project-img3col-right"><img src="images/projects/mojicoffee/mojicoffee-concept2logofaces.gif"></div>

		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>Suddenly every piece of ephemera bearing the logo has the potential to carry a message from one person to another. It's profoundly easy to draw a smiley face; even a non-verbal individual working in the shop could convey an emotion to a customer by utilizing the brand as their canvas.</p>
		<p class="last-p">Once the logo was developed, I started exploring colors and how the idea behind the mark could be brought to life and extended. I occurred to me that a circle is a very recurring shape inside of a copy shop; by featuring these found circles alongside the drawn faces on the logo, I began establishing an ownable symbol.</p></div>

		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p class="last-p">Ultimately the client chose a different direction to pursue for their final branding; while I was disappointed at the time I remain thrilled to have had the opportunity to play a part in bringing such an important idea to life in my community.</p></div>
