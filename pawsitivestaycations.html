		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The Setup</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>Running a small, local business can be an endeavor, and many have weak or no real branding presence and struggle to stand out to potential customers, even when one local business provides an excellent service relative to its competition. And in a field like in-home pet sitting, there's virtually no barrier to entry for new competitors to emerge in the space.</p>
		<p>Which can present a problem. In-home pet sitting requires giving someone you don't know access to your home when you're not around. As a hyper-local industry with many players coming and going, some with little more of an established face than a Facebook page, it can be hard for potential clientele to easily divide the excellent pet sitters from the not-so-great ones… or even worse, the bad actors playing the part to gain entry into your home.</p>
		<p class="last-p">When my wife and I found an excellent in-home caregiver for our cats while we're traveling, I offered to trade some branding work for pet sitting visits. I understood the advantage a strong, established face could provide and wanted to help craft the story new clients would glean as soon as they saw the Pawsitive Staycations logo for the first time.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Branding</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>This was one of those rare projects where you concept ideas for a time but then suddenly the idea finds you. The client had requested a brand that incorporated a chalkboard motif with handwritten type based around what little identity she had already established on Facebook. I did create and present an option in this vein as asked but knew she needed (and deserved) something better.</p>
		<p class="last-p">After playing with some concepts I kerned the initials P and S so tightly that they overlapped and I suddenly had a "eureka" moment: the figure-ground relationship of the PS had created a very clear shape of a dog between the letters. From that moment, as I added detail to the dog and then eventually included a cat, the logo practically designed itself. When the logo was presented, my client started crying.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Other Brand Elements</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>A strong logo is a huge leg-up, but to really sell the idea of an established brand to new clients some supporting elements are required as well.</p>
		<p class="last-p">I set to work creating these tertiary pieces: social assets, a sticker based on the logo, a T-shirt to act as a uniform for my client and her team to wear into people's homes, and a print ad to advertise the Pawsitive Staycations services.</p></div>
