		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">The Setup</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>IFB Solutions (née Winston-Salem Industries For The Blind) is an organization which hires workers with partial or full sight impairment, giving them meaningful employment in skilled manufacturing. From office supplies to mattresses to eyewear, IFB Solutions is an organization overflowing with good will and great stories of triumph.</p>
		<p>And their Optical division even more so: Producing nearly 2,000 pairs of lenses every day for veteran clients within the VA hospital system and U.S. Navy NEXCOM centers, IFB Optical literally allows the blind to give others their sight back.</p>
		<p class="last-p">To better tell this powerful brand story, as well as prepare for a more conventional-consumer-facing future in light of a shrinking veteran customer base, IFB Optical sought to rebrand itself and turned to writer <a class="project-a link" href="http://www.tallskinnyguy.com/" target="_blank">Gary Bostwick</a> and me to develop and evolve an original name and brand.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Naming</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>We explored a range of names, from made up words to former employees’ names (seriously, how awesome is the name, “Commodore Funderburk”?). Ultimately, the client pursued a direction that had some built-in context to the sight-impaired community and those in the eyewear industry.</p>
		<p class="last-p">If 20/20 is perfect vision, then 20/200 (”twenty, two-hundred”) is the threshold defining legal blindness, an ironic and playful name for an eyewear manufacturer. Working to abstract this somewhat, we settled on Twenty200.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Branding</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>With IFB Optical now renamed Twenty200, I set to work creating a brand to fit. We needed a mark that got out of the way so the viewer could easily read the name, but was thoughtful and established-looking enough to compete with the likes of Warby Parker.</p>
		<p class="last-p">Since the name is based on the prescription 20/200, I wanted to weave the slash between the numbers back into the logo. We applied it to the end of an otherwise unadorned wordmark, and the shape we call the “slash element” immediately brought the brand to life. By applying an array of vivid brand colors or expanding the shape to create an entire color field content can sit within, the door was opened to render the new identity in many expressive ways.</p></div>

		<div class="project-image-area project-grid-image-area project-grid-item project-img4col project-img4col-right"><img src="images/projects/twenty200/twenty200-packageconcept.jpg"></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Packaging</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>With an identity in place we began exploring how the brand extends to secondary and tertiary executions, starting with packaging. As one of their first objectives under the new Twenty200 banner, the client wanted veteran-facing packaging to be the immediate refreshed brand touchpoint.</p>
		<p class="last-p">We applied the brand to a printed shipping box, saving production costs by producing generic boxes in bulk and applying delivery and customer info through a printed sticker. A pamphlet finished to the exact inner dimensions of the packaging and waiting on top of the product when the box is opened creates an Apple-like brand interaction and ensures the important information associated with the glasses must be acknowledged before they are unpacked and worn for the first time.</p></div>

		<div class="project-marker project-grid-marker project-grid-item">Experiential <br>&amp; In-Store</div>
		<div class="project-intro-copy project-copy project-grid-copy project-grid-item"><p>While the VA has relatively restrictive guidelines on outside vendors’ “in-store” experiences, we worked within these boundaries to develop a prototype space inside the Twenty200 offices that would serve as a guide for their build-out team as they traveled the country upfitting IFB Optical clinics into Twenty200 Eyewear shops.</p>
		<p>Twenty200 partners with lens and frame suppliers as well, offering (for example) Kodak lenses ground to patients’ prescriptions by Twenty200 low-vision employees or Ray-Ban frames fitted with Twenty200-manufactured lenses. Twenty200 sells vendor and affiliate advertising within their eyewear shops to these partners, so it was important that we provide blank areas in the space that could allow affiliate-branded collateral to be dropped in.</p>
		<p class="last-p">The mockup worked well and has been used effectively as a template for many Twenty200 Eyewear shops inside VA hospitals across the country. And, with the veteran population in decline and VA funding in flux, our prototype should serve as an effective template for true consumer-facing retail locations in the future.</p></div>
